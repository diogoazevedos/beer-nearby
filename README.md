# Beer Nearby

## Search beers

To search beers use the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com) third-party service, it's very complete, but debounce your requests, since the API has a rate limit of `3600` requests per hour. They already use a CloudFront to cache similar requests, so it can be handy to us.

## Check-in

```sh
$ curl -6 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @checkIn.json https://api.contentful.diogo.im/check_in
```

Where the `checkIn.json` looks like:

```js
{
  "latitude": /* Number between -90 and 90 */,
  "longitude": /* Number between -180 and 180 */,
  "beer": {
    "id": /* The beer ID from Punk API */,
    "name": /* The beer name from Punk API */,
    "tagline": /* The beer tagline from Punk API */,
    "description": /* The beer description from Punk API */
  }
}
```

## What's nearby

```sh
$ curl -6 https://api.contentful.diogo.im/look_nearby?latitude=<latitude>&longitude=<longitude>
```

Where `latitude` is a number between `-90` and `90` and `longitude` is a number between `-180` and `180`.

The response looks like:

```js
[{
  "latitude": /* The location latitude */,
  "longitude": /* The location longitude */,
  "distance": /* The distance between you and the location in meter */,
  "beers": [{
    "id": /* The beer ID from Punk API */,
    "name": /* The beer name from Punk API */,
    "tagline": /* The beer tagline from Punk API */,
    "description": /* The beer description from Punk API */,
    "image_url": /* The beer image url, generated using the ID and Punk API */,
  }]
}]
```

We love hops, so all four beers are big, bitter badasses, but by tweaking the amount of each hop used later in the boil and during dry- hopping, we can balance the malty backbone with some unexpected flavours.
